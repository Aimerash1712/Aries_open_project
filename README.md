# Aries_open_project

Project overview : This project employs the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, a cutting-edge transformer architecture. BERT has been fine-tuned on the SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) to interpret and generate human-like responses. The main goal is to enable users to upload a PDF document, pose specific questions regarding its content, and receive precise answers in real-time.
